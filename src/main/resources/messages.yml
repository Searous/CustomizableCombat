# This config contains all in-game chat messages and a few console messages
# All messages support sounds (if applicable), however the current
# method used to allow comments in configs will delete modifications to
# the structure seen below. If you really want this, try setting this file to
# read only.
#
# Built in placeholders:
# %player% - The player who performed the action or executed the command
# %target% - The other player, or target. You may use %other% for the same purpose as well
# %value% - A value, usually true or false, used as the "value" of the current context
# %special% - A special string which is different for each message, and is set internally
# %key% - The key or path to the current message
#
# If PlaceholderAPI is present, you may use these as well, more will be added later:
# %customizablecombat_pvp_preference% - The pvp preference of the player
# %customizablecombat_pvp_override_enabled% - If global PvP is enabled
# %customizablecombat_pvp_override_setting% - The setting forced by the global override, if enabled

# Chat prefix. Added to the beginning of all strings in the messages section
chat-prefix: ''
# Set this to false to force disable PlaceholderAPI. Does nothing if it is not installed
use-placeholder-api: true
# Fallback message if something breaks. You should never see this.
message-not-found: '&cNo message found: %key%'

# Words used for the %value% placeholder
words:
  true: '&bon'
  false: '&boff'

# A sorted list of messages. These support placeholders and chat colors.
# To add sound to a message, look at "inform-disabled" under player.
# The sound field is the internal name of the sound, a list can be found
# here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Sound.html
# These names should closely match those used with the /playsound command
